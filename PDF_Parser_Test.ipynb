       "   {'text': 'The ﬁnding that the Nrf2 activator, Protandim (Prot), increased longevity in genetically heterogeneous mice is consistent with previous reports, suggesting that Nrf2 activation may be causally associated with increased lifespan. Although we cannot rule out effects at other targets by the individual constituents of the mixture of compounds contained in Prot, the increase in expression of xenobiotic response genes in the livers of mice in the present study at the 1200 ppm dose (data not shown) further supports the idea that the effects of Prot on longevity may be at least partly due to Nrf2 activation. For example, Leiser & Miller (2010) reported that primary skin-derived ﬁbroblasts from the long-lived Snell dwarf mutant mouse manifest elevated levels of Nrf2, higher levels of glutathione, and increased resistance to plasma membrane lipid peroxidation. Consistent with those ﬁndings, mRNA levels for Nrf2-sensitive genes were reported to be elevated in selected tissues of Snell dwarf mice (Leiser & Miller, 2010). Taken together, these results suggest that Nrf2 activation may contribute to the stress resistance and increased longevity observed in the Snell dwarf mouse. In the present study, only male mice showed positive effects of Prot on longevity. This sex-speciﬁc effect may be due to differences in how males and females metabolize and/or eliminate any or all of 5 constituents present in the mixture of compounds contained in Prot. Alternatively, there may be sex differences in the mechanisms that control the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. For example, Sykiotis & Bohmann (2008) reported that  D .  melanogaster  carrying a loss of function mutation in Keap1 had increased Nrf2 activity, increased oxidative stress resistance, and elevated longevity, but in male ﬂies only. Although male mice in the present study had a signiﬁcant extension of median lifespan, they did not show an increase in maximal lifespan, suggesting that the effects of Prot are most beneﬁcial earlier in life. Phase II studies examining the effects of doses higher and lower than those used in the present study may be informative in this regard. In addition, studies examining the response to Prot over the lifespan may also help elucidate mechanisms underlying the different effects of Prot earlier and later in the lifespan. Metformin (Met) has been reported to increase longevity in male mice of the C57BL/6 inbred stock (Martin-Montalvo  et al. , 2013) at a dose of 1000 ppm, started at 54 weeks of age, leading to an increase in mean lifespan of 5.8%. This increase was deemed to be signiﬁcant using the Gehan – Breslow statistic, which gives greater emphasis to deaths at earlier ages than the log-rank test used in our own work. It is not clear whether the use of the log-rank statistic for the C57BL/6 mice would have supported the inference of a signiﬁcant effect of Met. A parallel study of male B6C3F1 mice also suggested a beneﬁt of Met, with a 4% extension of mean lifespan (Gehan – Breslow  P  =  0.06).

First, the failure of NDGA, at 2500 ppm, to increase longevity in female mice (Strong et al. , 2008) seems not to be due merely to lower blood concentrations of this agent in females, because we fail to see increased female lifespan even at a concentration, 5000 ppm, that produces blood levels similar to those seen in males at 2500 ppm (Harrison  et al. , 2014). In addition, our new data replicate the earlier ﬁnding of longevity increase using 2500 ppm in males and show that beneﬁts are also seen at twofold higher and threefold lower doses. NDGA did not, however, signiﬁcantly alter the proportion of mice alive at the 90th percentile at any dose, suggesting that its positive effects may be limited to the middle portion of the lifespan. The percentage increase in median male lifespan increases with dose at TJL (7%, 16%, 19%) and at UT (5%, 11%, 15%), but not at UM (7%, 2%,  � 7%), which may reﬂect the consistent, but unexplained, pattern of higher longevity in UM control males compared with control males at the other two test sites.

The features of the ITP design, including parallel studies in males and females at each of three laboratory sites, the use of genetically heterogeneous mice to guard against conclusions based on a single, typically inbred, genotype, and the use of enough numbers of mice to provide decent statistical power for modest (e.g. 10%) lifespan beneﬁts have now stimulated new ideas and impetus on several biogerontological fronts. ITP studies of rapamycin have helped to motivate new work on mTOR and aging in cells, mice, and even human studies, while newer observations on acarbose and, now, 17aE2 are expected to focus experimental attention on glucose transients and sex steroids as potential mediators of age-related diseases and as potential guides to human preventive trials. Many of the drugs are known to be safe in humans (for short-term or long-term use), and clinical studies are easy to imagine and in some cases, for example, rapamycin and acarbose, are already underway even prior to a deﬁnitive molecular understanding of target(s). We note that some of the most impressive ITP longevity results, such as those seen with acarbose and 17aE2, reﬂect physiological pathways that are not easy to model in worms or ﬂies, whose pathways of starch digestion and steroid sensitivity differ dramatically from those used by mammals. The growing availability of tissue banks from mice treated with these agents should serve as a spur toward increased collaboration on the pathways by which these drugs lead to preserved health and postponed mortality in mice.',\n",
